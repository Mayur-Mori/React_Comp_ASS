                    <li>The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook.
                        It's used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently
                        with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of
                        as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which,
                        when assembled, form the application's entire user interface. </li>

                        npm is the world's largest Software Library (Registry)
                        npm is also a software Package Manager and Installer
                        The name npm (Node Package Manager) stems from when npm first was created as a package manager
                        for Node.js.

                    <li>
                        npm is an abbreviation used for the node package manager. It is a package manager for
                        JavaScript. It is the default package manager that comes with NodeJS when you install it. It
                        consists of a command-line interface and an online database of public packages and private
                        packages that are paid which is called the npm Registry.

            <div class="answer" id="answer3">
                : There are specific reasons to use the deadly combination of Node.js and React for web app development.
                Here are a few:
                <ul>
                    <li>NodeJS is a framework of JavaScript which is mainly used for working with the
                        backend of our application or building the backend using JavaScript, whereas ReactJS
                        is a JavaScript front-end library. It is mainly used for building the user interface</li>
                    <li> <b> 1. Scalability </b></li>
                    The combination of Node and React allows developers to build dynamic, large, data-driven web apps
                    that are responsive across multiple devices. It would help if you had scalability while working on
                    large projects and maintaining your website’s performance.
                    <br>

                    <li> <b>2. MERN Stack </b></li>
                    MERN Stack means MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. And no better combo than these frameworks can
                    provide a unique dimension to a website. You can use Node.js with MERN Stack alongside React.js.
                    Hence, you can use the Node and React combination for web app development.
                    <br>

                    <li> <b>3. JSON APIs </b></li>
                    Creating JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) APIs for web development is competent due to the high
                    code reusability and access to immediate code sharing in React.js. And Node.js can effectively allow
                    this.
                    <br>

                    <li> <b>4. Real-Time Data </b></li>
                    If your business app handles real-time data management or aims to build a data streaming app, you
                    should use Node.js as your app requires an ongoing server connection.
                    <br>

                    <li> <b>5. Fast Development </b></li>
                    When using the combination of React and Node for web app development, you can receive a high ROI and
                    save your money and time. After all, these technologies work excellently to offer an effective
                    platform for building rapid functioning and easy-to-maintain websites.
                    <br>
                    <li> <b> 6. SPAs (Single Page Applications) </b></li>
                    Does your business require a single-page app with asynchronous data loading? Then, you must select
                    React with Node back-end as it allows building a lightweight back-end model through callback
                    functions.
                    <br>
                    <li> <b> 7. Single Language for Front-end and Back-end </b></li>
                    With the combination of Node and React, developers don’t require learning complex back-end languages
                    like Python or Ruby. They can use Node for server-side development and React for front-end code
                    building without switching between frameworks and programming languages. And it saves resources,
                    money, and time.
                    <br>
                    <li> <b>8. High Server Load</b></li>
                    The combination of Node.js and React can balance the high server requests and load when developers
                    work on web app development.
                    <br>
                    <li> <b>9. Organized Process</b></li>
                    The deadly combination of React and Node create an organized web development process. After all,
                    these technologies are scalable, effective, and fast. When working together, they can help you build
                    high-functioning websites.
                    <br>
                    <li> <b>10. Increased Use of JavaScript</b></li>
                    Node with React enables the use of the total strength of JavaScript for building front-end and
                    back-end codes. It gives more freedom and convenience when building websites or web apps, as you can
                    use one language for every aspect.

                    <li>
                        create-react-app has taken care of setting up the main structure of the application as well as a
                        couple of developer settings. Most of what you see will not be visible to the visitor of your
                        web app. React uses a tool called webpack which transforms the directories and files here into
                        static assets.

                        A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every
                        application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components
                        make the task of building UIs much easier. You can see a UI broken down into multiple individual
                        pieces called components and work on them independently and merge them all in a parent component
                        which will be your final UI.

            </div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer6">
                <ul>
                    <li>React projects are built with Components. To build web applications with React you need to think
                        in Components. </li>
                    <li>React would best be described as a library for creating user interfaces. Think of Components as
                        the elements of user interfaces. For example, your site might be made up of the following
                        Components </li>
                    <li>
                        App, Header, Logo, NavBar, NavLink, Content, Card, Footer
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each of these elements would be separate Components, and you would define a file for each.
                        Component files are always named after the component they contain: App.jsx, Header.jsx,
                        Logo.jsx, NavBar.jsx, NavLink.jsx, Content.jsx, Card.jsx, and Footer.jsx.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        So in header component we put all the code related to header .

                        To change the state of the React component is useful when you are working on a single page
                        application, it simply replaces the content of the existing component for the user without
                        reloading the webpage.

                    <li>
                        We have to set initial state value inside constructor function and set click event handler of
                        the
                        element upon which click, results in changing state. Then pass the function to the click handler
